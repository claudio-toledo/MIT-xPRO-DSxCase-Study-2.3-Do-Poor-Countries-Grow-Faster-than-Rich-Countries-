Case Study 2.3: Do Poor Countries Grow Faster than Rich Countries? Instructor: Victor Chernuzkov Activity Type: Optional  Case Study Description: Answer the question: ¨Do poor countries grow faster than rich countries?¨by using a large dimensional dataset. Why this Case Study? Participants are equipped with tools which can handle high dimensional datasets. They can apply these tools to any high dimensional dataset. Self-Help Package Contents:   The video that covers this case study is given in Module 2, Segment 2.4.  Self-Help-Package.zip  Codebook.txt contains the name of the variables and a brief description. growth.Rdata: The dataset contains the variables used in the regression. Regression 2.4.CaseStudy.R: looks at how the rates at which economies of different countries grow related to initial wealth levels in each country controlling for several country-specific characteristics. This relationship is estimated in two ways. In the first analysis, a simple regression linear model is used. In the second analysis control variables are partialled out using the Lasso method and then residuals of the dependent variable are regressed on residuals of the indepedent variable. Regression.2.4.pdf is the set of slides that describes the estimation technique and present the results. .Rapp.history .Rhistory
